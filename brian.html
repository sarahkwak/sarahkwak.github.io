				<h1>Hi, My name is Brian and I am a dog.</h1>
				<p>Puggle, more exact. I don't know if my biological mom was pug or beagle but I am half pug and half beagle. If you want to know more about puggle, I encourage you check this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONM_DXIP1Vw">video</a>.</p>
				<p>I don't know exactly when I was born, but my adoption paper says I am 2-years-old puggle and that was 4 years ago. That makes me 6. I am a 6 years old puggle and I am a developer.</p>
				<p>I used to want to be a doctor but I changed my mind when Sarah became a developer. She is a rails developer and I am more of javascript kind of dog.</p>

			<p>This is an example of what I build recently. I was teaching javascript to neighborhood puppies and got me thinking. What are they really interested? They are surely into cookies and poops! Yes. They love poopin! So I wrote very simple javascript game about that!  </p>
