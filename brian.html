				<p>Puggle, more exact. I don't know if my biological mom was pug or beagle but I am half pug and half beagle. If you want to know more about puggle, I encourage you watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONM_DXIP1Vw">video</a>.</p>
				<p>
				I also participated in editing <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puggle'>puggle wikipedia</a> article so you should check it out if you are curious about my kind. 
				</p>
				<p>I don't know exactly when I was born, but my adoption paper says I am 2-years-old puggle and that was 4 years ago. That makes me 6. I am a 6 years old puggle and I am a developer.</p>
				<p>I like vegetable because they are crunch and I like to rub in smelly clothes. These are a few of my favorite things.</p>
