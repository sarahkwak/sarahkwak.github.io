      I am so glad that I watched the Shereef's video. As I do not have any coding experience other than learning from online resources for a couple of months, I was worrying great deal about being a burden of the team and being left out. I like what Shereef said: It's like walking from San Francisco to Seattle. 100 steps ahead looks like 25 times more than where I am but it is not much far ahead in a big picture.

      The comparason betweeen being in a kitchen and a restaurant makes perfect sense. I have been many academic institutes in my life and I have never thought about it in this way. I have successfuly completed all schools I started but I haven't enjoyed any of them. I guess this is close to 'Aha moment' to me. I have always consider myself as a customer in the restaurant, I have never thought of being a chef! </p>

      After all, this is my experience and my journey.

      I am very excited about the journey. The decision to enroll DBC wasn't an easy one and one of best decisions I've ever made. I think this is very exciting time for people in coding and there are many opportunities in the world. More importantly, I am super happy about the decision!
