    <h5>Sarah</h5>
    <div class="group">
    <img class="main" src="blog/stylesheets/sarah.jpeg" />
  <p>Sarah was born and grew up in Korea(South). She studied Chemistry in college. After graduation, instead of study further in Chemistry, she started her career in a diplomatic world. Sarah's first job was Senior Visa Officer at Australian Embassy in Seoul. Sarah worked there for 4 years and moved to Australia and enrolled Master's of Commerce class in University of New South Wales. After finishing her course in 2008, she decided to move to Canada for new life.</p>
  <p>For the first 6 months in Canada, she studied French but unfortunately, all she can confidently say is "elle ne peut pas parler fran√ßais". Although she claimed that she is able to understand french conversation but this is not verified fact. All we know is that when she was in Montreal all she asked was: "pouvez -vous parler anglais ?"</p>
  <p>She'd lived in Ottawa, the capital city of Canada for nearly 3 years and moved to Victoria, BC because of her job. She was worked as a Quality Auditor and Inspector for the Victoria class submarines. How she learned about submarine operation and safety regulation is still unsure.</p>
  <p>Now Sarah is in California learning programming languages. She is very excited about new career and life in San Francisco. </p>

<h5>Brian</h5>
<div class=group>
<img class="main" src="blog/stylesheets/brian.jpg" />
<p>Brian is 3 years old pug and beagle cross (and he doesn't like the sound of 'puggle' so he always introduce himself as 'pug-kind'). Brian is currently living with Sarah in California but he is originally from Alberta, Canada. He was with someone else for the first 2 years of his life in Alberta and moved to Victoria, BC. How he ended up in SPCA in Victoria is unclear. If you ask Brian, he would say "none of your business but it wasn't my fault.".</p>
<p>Brian loves vegetables and fruits. Brian loves anything crunch except celery. He enjoys sunbathe and nap is big part of his life. He doesn't want to call himself a lasy dog but he is definitely not a morning dog. Here is an example of typical day of Brian. </p>
  <ol style="line-height: 2">
    <h4>Brian's Daily Schedule</h3>
    <li>  Wake up whenever Sarah wakes up(this could be 8:00)</li>
    <li>  Asking for breakfast</li>
    <li>  Morning bathroom</li>
    <li>  Nap time until Sarah's lunch time</li>
    <li>  Having snack with Sarah. In Brian's opinion, Sarah isn't very generous person. She's never share whole lunch with Brian.</li>
    <li>  Taking nap until Sarah wakes him up for walk or jogging</li>
    <li>  Jogging/walk with Sarah and afternoon bathroom time</li>
    <li>  Dinner. Dinner is served in between 4:30 to 6:00. It depends on Sarah's schedule</li>
    <li>  Watching TV and couch time with Sarah. Sarah is watching various commedy shows like 'family guy', 'futurama', 'portlandia' and sometimes sad movies. Although Brian isn't a big fan of watching TV and movies, he is joining with Sarah and trying to be a good companion.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Brian does not like Sarah is going to go to coding school in Feb, 2015. A school means Brian being home alone. While Sarah is learning to code, Brian is also trying to learn programming languages with Sarah but in his opinion, Sarah does not explain things properly. </p>
