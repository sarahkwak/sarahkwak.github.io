      <h1>&nbsp;Gang Of Four - Ruby Decorator</h1>
      <h2>Aug 12, 2017&nbsp;</h2>
    </div>
    <p>A Decorator is a design pattern. <strong>It Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.</strong></p>
    <div class="tutorial">
      module Milk
        def cost
          super + 0.4
        end
      end

      module Sugar
        def cost
          super + 0.2
        end
      end

      class Coffee
        def cost
          2
        end
      end


      java = Coffee.new
      java.extend(Milk) # => 2.4
      java.extend(Sugar) # => 2.6
      java.cost   # 2.6
    </div>
    <p>This magical 'extend' looks bit intimidating. Plus the argument it passes are module (Milk and Sugar), not a class. and <strong>super</strong> keywords are in the module, again, not in class. It's bit unusual case but you can see how elegantly it attaches responsibilities to class from those modules. Interesting part is also when it calls <em>`extend(Sugar)`</em> it does not only returns 2 + 0.2, it actually added up Milk price as well. That's because <strong>super</strong> and it gets whatever its value and then added 0.2. </p>
    <h4>Include vs Extend</h4>
    <p>Include is a Mixin. When a class `includes` a module (and that's always the case, you don't mixin a class and it throws TypeError), that module's instance methods become available as instance methods of the class.  It's almost as if the module becomes a superclass of the class that uses it. Great thing about including module is that you can include many different classes and inheritance chain. If multiple modules are included, they are added to the chain in order.</p>
    <p>If a module itself includes other modules, a chain of proxy classes will be added to any class that includes that module, one proxy for each module that is directly or indirectly included.</p>
    <div class="tutorial">
      module Cream
        def fat
          puts "very fatty"
        end
      end

      module Milk
        include Cream

        def cost
         0.4
        end
      end

      module Cream
        def cost
         0.9
        end
      end

      class Coffee
        # include can be chained in order
        include Milk
        include Cream

        def cost
          super + 0.2
        end
      end

    Coffee.new.cost # => 1.1
    Coffee.new.fat # => "very fatty"
    </div>
    <p>Extending object isn't also much different. You can mix a module into an object using Object#extend. There is an interesting trick with extend. If you use it within a class definition, the module's methods become class methods. Also extend doesn't care left side of argument. Even string can use method if it is extended. But it is only allow to module to be extended. </p>

      module Cream
        def fat
          puts "very fatty"

        def cost
          super + 2
        end
      end

      Coffee.new.extend(Sugar).cost # => wrong argument type Class (expected Module) (TypeError)
      Coffee.extend(Cream).fat # => very fatty
      a = "hello"
      a.extend(Sugar).cost # => 0.4
      a.extend(Coffee).cost # => TypeError 'Coffee is not module'

    <h4>Alternative Decorator - Plain Old Ruby Object Decorator</h4>
    <p>Ruby allows to passing responsibilities by passing objects around as an argument using initialize. </p>
    <div class="tutorial">
      class Coffee
        def cost
          2
        end

        def origin
          "Colombia"
        end
      end

      class Milk
        def initialize(component)
          @component = component
        end

        def cost
          @component.cost + 0.4
        end
      end

      coffee = Coffee.new
      Sugar.new(Milk.new(coffee)).cost  # 2.6
      Sugar.new(Sugar.new(coffee)).cost # 2.4
      Sugar.new(Milk.new(coffee)).class # Sugar
      Milk.new(coffee).origin           # NoMethodError
    </div>
    <h4>Alternative Decorator - 'Method Missing' decorator</h4>
    <div class="tutorial">
      module Decorator
        def initialize(component)
          @component = component
        end

        def method_missing(meth, *args)
          if @component.respond_to?(meth)
            @component.send(meth, *args)
          else
            super
          end
        end

        def respond_to?(meth)
          @component.respond_to?(meth)
        end
      end

      class Coffee
        def cost
          2
        end

        def origin
          "Colombia"
        end
      end

      class Milk
        include Decorator

        def cost
          @component.cost + 0.4
        end
      end

      class Sugar
        include Decorator
        def cost
          @component.cost + 0.2
        end
      end

      coffee = Coffee.new
      Sugar.new(Milk.new(coffee)).cost   # 2.6
      Sugar.new(Sugar.new(coffee)).cost  # 2.4
      Sugar.new(Milk.new(coffee)).origin # Colombia
      Sugar.new(Milk.new(coffee)).class  # Sugar
    </div>
  </body>
