    	<h1>&nbsp;What is Ruby's ||= Really Does</h1>
      <h2>Feb 1, 2017</h2>
    </div>
    <p><strong>A common misconception is that a ||= b is equivalent to <mark>a = a ||= b</mark>, but it behaves like <mark> a || a = b</mark></strong></p>
    <p>In <mark>a = a || b</mark>, a is set to something by the statement on every run, whereas with <mark> a || a = b</mark>, a is only set if a is logically false (i.e. if it's <mark>nil or false</mark>) because || is 'short circuiting'. That is if the left hand side of the || comparison is true, there is no need to check the right hand side.</p>
    <div class="tutorial">
   case1. When 'a' is nil or false
   a = nil 
   b = 7
   a ||= b 	
     a => <mark>7</mark>
     b => <mark>7</mark>
    </div>

		<div class="tutorial">
   case2. When 'a' has a truethy value
   a = 17
   b = 19
   a ||= b
     a => <mark>17</mark>
     b => <mark>19</mark>
		</div>

	<h4>Simple Memoization with ||= </h4>
	<p>Memoizataion is a technique you can use to speed up your accessor methods. It caches the results of methods that do time-consuming work, work that only needs to be done onece. In Rails, you see memoization used so often that it even included a <a href='http://apidock.com/rails/v3.2.13/ActiveSupport/Memoizable/memoize'>module that would memoize methods</a> for you. We will see that later.</p>

	<div class="tutorial">
	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
	  def twitter_followers
		@twitter_followers ||= twitter_user.followers
	  end
 	end 
	</div>
	<p>The twitter_followers interpreted to: </p>
	<p><mark>@twitter_followers = @twitter_followers || twitter_user.followers</mark>. That means that you'll only make the network call the first time you call <mark>twitter_followers</mark>, and future calls will just return the value of the instance variable <mark>@twitter_followers</mark></p>

	<h4>Multi-line memoization</h4>
	<div class="tutorial">
	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
	  def main_address
	    @main_address ||= begin
	      maybe_main_address = home_address if prefers_home_address?
	      maybe_main_address = work_address unless maybe_main_address
	      maybe_main_address = address.first unless maybe_main_address
	    end
	  end 
	end
	</div>

	<p>The <mark>begin..end</mark> creates a block of code in Ruby that can be treated as a single thing. That's why ||= works just as well here as it did before.</p>
	<h4>What about nil? </h4>
	<p>The problem is that when right side of the expression returns nil, it will perform the expensive fetches again. So instead of using <mark>||=</mark>, consider if / else statement. </p>
	<div class="tutorial">
	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
	 def twitter_followers
	  return @twitter_followers if defined? @twitter_followers
	  @twitter_followers = twitter_user.followers
	 end
	end
	</div>
	<p>In order to understand the above example, let's talk about 'defined?'. 'defined?' is <strong>Conditional Execution</strong>. <mark>defined?</mark> operator returns nil if its argument (which can be an arbitrary expression) is not defined, otherwise it returns a description of that argument. If the argument is <mark>yield, defined?</mark> returns the string 'yield' if a code block is associated with the current context. Here are the examples.</p>
	<div class="tutorial">
	defined? 1 => "expression"
	defined? String  => 'constant'
	definedd? c = 1  => 'assignment'
	a = 1
	defined? a  => 'local_variable'
	b = nil 
	defined?  b  => 'local_variable'
	defined? dd  => nil
	dd = 3 if defined? dd  => 3
	</div>
	<p>So go back to the our exmample of <mark>@twitter_followers</mark>, if it returns nil, instead of it will run and try to set @twitter_followers, it will be just nil. </p>
	<h4>What about parameters?</h4>
	<p>We have some memoization patterns that work well for simple accessors. <strong>But what if you want to memoize a method that takes parameters?</strong></p>
	<div class="tutorial">
	#app/models/city.rb
	class City < ActiveRecord::Base
	  def self.top_cities(order_by)
	    where(top_city: true).order(order_by).to_a
	  end
	end
	</div>
	<p>It turns out that Ruby's <mark>Hash</mark> has an initalizer that works perfectly for this situation. Before going into this, let's look at what new { |hash, key| block } statement.</p>
	<p>The block passed after the new keyword is pattern to create default value. When you pass block after Hash.new, it will creates a new default object each time. For instance</p>
	<div class="tutorial">
	h = Hash.new {|hash, key| hash[key] = 'Go Fish: #{key}'}
	h['c']  => 'Go Fish: c'
	h['d'].update!  => 'GO FISH: D'
	h.keys => ['c', 'd']
	</div>
	<p>Now, look at this example</p>
	<div class="tutorial">
	class City < ActiveRecord::Base
	  def self.top_cities(order_by)
	    @top_cities ||= Hash.new do |hash, key|
	      h[key] = where(top_city: true).order(key).to_a
	    end
	    @top_cities[order_by]
	  end
	end
	</div>
	<p><strong>No matter what you pass into order_by, the correct result will get memoized.</strong>Since the block is only called when the key doesn't exist, you don't have to worry about the result of the block being nil or false.</p>
