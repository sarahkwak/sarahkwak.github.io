      <h6>Stereotype Threat</h1>

<h4>Are We Living in a Programmed World?</h4>
<p>Who am I?</p>
<p>That is a fundamental question. The question determines my identity, role and responsibility. There is always 'expectation' of being something and someone. Social expectation isn't always necessarily bad but it could bad enough that change someone's life. We are all trying to meet 'expectation' of someone - parents, friends, colleagues, supervisor, neighbors sometimes people we barely know or we've just met. Stereotype is powerful and it's everywhere.</p>
<p>Who I am defines everything. It defines my ability to drive or solve math problems, preference of sports and most importantly, my future career. I supposed to do well in math and like chemistry and biology but not machanical engineering. I could become an accountant and successful financially but I have about 10% of chance to be a senior management level in today's corporation. Wait. No. It's about 2% considering my ethnicity.</p>
<p>My parents are proud of me because I am somewhat outside of the stereotype but not entirely out. I am meeting somewhat their expectations and society acceptable because I am in a good 'range' of where I am supposed to be. </p>

<p>By the way, I used to work in defense industry with average age group of 50+ mostly retired military personnels. Whereever I go, I am being treated as someone I am'supposed to be'. I think I tried pathetically hard to break that expectation and pretend someone I am not. I was and am still in obsession with breaking expectations and consider that as an achievement. Perhaps I can say breaking stereotype and expectation is my real zeal. </p>
<p>It's not a secret. The world isn't fair and kind as much as it is to others. I wasn't discouraged to be an engineer but I wasn't encouraged to be. I wasn't encourage to find true passion rather, I was taught to like what I have. No one think it is wrong to be a bad driver and underachiever. It was way 'I' supposed to be. </p>
<h4>Past and Future</h4>
<p>My way of coping stereotype threats was logic. Logical thinking. I admit the fact that there is stereotype threats and that discourage me to achieve certain thing. Like being a great driver. (Yes. I am a bad driver and I often joke about me being a bad driver because I am Asian.) This is not true. Unlike the popular believe! My poor driving skill is purely due to my lack of experience. I am sure I would be a competent driver if I had more chance to DRIVE! </p>
<p>As same logic goes I think women can be good at science and math. At least as good as men. I believe women are underachieved in the areas because of lack of encouragement and different expectation. Perhaps we discourage our girls to be interested in science. Perhaps the pink dresses, popular Disney movies and  babies aren't exactly stimulate logical thinking as much as boy's toys like legos and trucks.  The argument on girls are naturally interested in language and arts much more than math and science is non-sense I think. </p>
<p>I would consider myself damn stupid if I believe I am good at math because I am Asian. Although that's what society would like to think. </p>
<p>The real agenda is how we reduce stereotype threats around us. What I can do to create more positive and stereotype-free(or less) environment? I guess the true and only answer is being a competent person. If I am a good driver, no one would even bring an issue. </p>

<p>I wish that's easy like that. Just good at everything. Because that is such an achievable goal - being a super person!, I would suggest a couple other things. <strong>Get out of comfort zone and don't judge others.</strong> Getting out of comfort zone is an excellent way of make oneself feel confident and show others that stereotyping is an urban myth. Try new food, new place, learn new skill and talk to other people and explore new areas are always great way to become bigger self. More importantly, take people's advice and feedback kindly and sincerely. I think that is one of my weaknesses. I am not used to deal with feedbacks and constantly having hard time accepting it. I am slowly and intentionally address the issue and I hope this will help my learning as well as being awesome self.</p>

<p>Stereotype treat is dangerous because we grew up with it. It is however shall not define ourselves. The truth is that we are responsible for ourselves in today. It is up to us to ignore it or challenge it. The bottomline is whatever choice we make that defines ourselves and our future. </p>
