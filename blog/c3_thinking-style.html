<h3>Concrete Sequential and Abstract Random Person</h3>
<img src="Screen-shot/thinking_style.png" style="width: 30%"/>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Personal Thinking Style test</a>, I have mainly exactly between Concrete Sequential and Abstract Random style, which I agree. (If you want to see the interpretation of the thinking style, visit<a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm"> Anthony Gregorc's </a> website).</p>
<p>According to Anthony Gregorc's interpretation, I tend to be based in reality. I process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way. Also, I organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments.</p>
<p>This is mainly true.  Although in a group environment, I try to be best to bring harmony to group environment and situation, if possible, I would like to avoid a group environment. I also do not like to work with 'unpredictable' people and being in competitive environment. </p>
<h3>So... how to use this information in learning?</h3>
<p>Although I am not a big fan of group activities, I am fairly well in structured environment - like being in a school and organized curriculum. I also like to get others' opinion and advice. As long as I respect others' opinion and try to improve myself, I think I will be excel in learning programming languages. I also believe my passion in continual learning will push me extra mile. </p>
