      <h6>Ruby classes vs. JavaScript constructor functions</h1>
      <h2>Date: Feb 05, 2015</h2>
<div class=tech-div>
  <hr>
  <p>Classes are very important in object-oriented programming. This is because a class tells us helpful information about objects, and you can think of an object as a particular instance of a class.</p>

  <p>There are several difference between Ruby classes and JavaScript Constructor functions. First, Ruby class is can be instanciate by Class.new attribute but JavaScript needs a special function called 'prototype'. </p>
  <p>Here is an example of Ruby's class and instantiate process. </p>
    <div class=text-editor>
    class Person
      def initialize(name, phone_number, address)
        @name = name
        @phone_number = phone_number
        @address = address
      end

      def print_out
        puts "#{@name}, #{@phone_number}, #{@address}"
      end
    end

  sarah = Person.new("Sarah Kwak", "650-3810-9918", "140 Belvedere Ave. San Carlos, CA 94070")

  sarah.print_out
  =>
  Sarah Kwak, 650-3810-9918, 140 Belvedere Ave. San Carlos, CA 94070

</div>
<p>JavScript has 'object constructor' does do similar job but have little bit different way. Here is an example.

<div class=text-editor>
  Person = function(name, phone_number, address) {
    this.name = name,
    this.phone_number = phone_number,
    this.address = address
  };
  sarah = new Person("Sarah Kwak", "650-381-9918", "140 Belvedere Ave. San Carlos,
  CA 94070");
  console.log(sarah);
  =>
  { name: 'Sarah Kwak',
  phone_number: '650-381-9918',
  address: '140 Belvedere Ave. San Carlos, CA 94070' }

  </div>
<p>The thing is that not everything can be easily inherited to the class instance. The special keyword 'prototype' allows any function to be inherited to the class instance. </p>
<div class=text-editor>

  Dog = function(name, breed, age) {
    this.name = name,
    this.breed = breed,
    this.age = age
  };
  Dog.prototype.complain = function () {
      console.log("My name is "+this.name +" and I need COOKIES!");
  };
  brian = new Dog("Brian", "puggle", 3);
  brian.complain();
  =>
  My name is Brian and I need COOKIES!

  </div>

  <p>"Inheritance Chain" means if a property is not defined for a class, this class's prototype chain will be traversed upwards until one is found (or not) in a parent (higher) class.</p>

  <div class = text-editor>
  Animal = function(kind) {
      this.kind = kind,
      this.numLegs = 4
  };

  Animal.prototype.peace = function() {
      console.log("We all love peace!");
  };

  Dog = function(name, breed, age) {
    this.name = name,
    this.breed = breed,
    this.age = age
  };

  Dog.prototype = new Animal(); // This will make Brian = Dog = Animal
  brian = new Dog("Brian", "puggle", 3);
  console.log(brian.numLegs);
  brian.peace();
  =>
  4
  We all love peace!

</div>
