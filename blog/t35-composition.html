    	<h1>&nbsp;OOP Composition vs Inheritance</h1>
      <h2>Feb 8, 2017</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Be aware. This is heavy topic. Composition vs Inheritance is the topic that I would love to ignore and think as something that I've never have to worry about in real life. It's not that this is hard to understand or anything but I feel like it's not really useful in real life application. AND as always I WAS WRONG.</p>
    <p><strong>Designing object-oriented software is hard, and designing </strong><mark>reusable </mark><strong> object-oriented software is even harder.</strong></p>
    <h4>Quick Conclusion and the Theory</h4>
    <p>In a composition-based system, the various components get combined togeter at run-time to create the desired behavior. This allows flexibility to build behavior dynamically without having to resort to clever metaprogramming tricks.</p>
    <p>Composition has a few downsides too. It tends to add more indirection to a system. It can also be more work to assemble all the components together into the deesired behavior. Anything that can be implemented via inheritance can alternatively be implemented using composition.</p>
    <p>Use inheritance when the cost of indirection and construction of a composition-based approach is higher than the benefits of encapsulated responsibilities and flexibilities. </p>
    <h4>Inheritance: Alter Before and After</h4>
    <p>So we all know how inheritance works. It inherites from parent class so the child can have exactly same behavior. For example:</p>
    <div class="tutorial">
  class Parent
    def hello(person)
      puts "Dad, say hi to #{person}"
    end 
  end

  class Child < Parent 
    def hello(person)
      puts "Son, say hi to #{person}"
      super
      puts "Guesswhat, #{person}"
    end
  end 

  son = Child.new
  son.hello('sister')
  => 
  Son, say hi to sister
  Dad, say hi to sister
  Guesswhat, sister
    </div>
    <p><mark>super</mark> calls the same name method of the parent class, if it exists. Also it passes all the arguments to the parent class method as well. </p>
    <h4>using super() with initialize</h4>
  </body>
	<div class="tutorial">
  class Parent
    def initialize(person) 
      @person = person
    end 

    def hello
      puts "Dad, say hi #{person} "
    end 
  end

  class Child < Parent 
    def initialize(person)
      @person = person
      super
    end
  end 	

  father = Parent.new("sister")
  son = Child.new("brother")
  son.hello => Dad, say hi brother
	</div>
