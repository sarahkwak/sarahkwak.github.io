    <h6>JavaScript Interview Questions</h6>
    <h2>July 24, 2015</h2>
    <div class=tech-div>
    <ol>
      <li>Explain event delegation</li>
      <p>Event delegation is tagetting element may not exist in current DOM and attach the event when they show up. Here is the example. $(this) is the special variable represents the target element. </p>
      <div class="tutorial">
  #index.html
  &lt;ol class='dog-group'&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  #main.js
  $(".dog-group").on('click', 'li', function() {
    $(this).addClass('highlight');
  });
      </div>
      <p>This function will get the element of '.dog-group' and target 'li' and attach the function which addClass 'highlight'.</p>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>Explain how 'this' works in JavaScript</li>
      <div class=interview>
        <p>'This' is in general referring to the objects that the function can be called. For instance within a function this.name = name; means whatever instance of the object's name will be called. In summary, 'this' in general refer something left side of dog notation. If not, it is usually refer 'window'. Because everything ouside of the scoup of the function belongs to 'window'</p>
      </div>
      <li>Explain how prototype inheritance works</li>
      <div class=interview>
        <p>In object oriented concept, prototype will inherite whatever right side of prototype notation to be inherited to left side of the object. prototype can also inherite constructor function so that left side of the object can be a constructor for other objects with 'new' keyword.</p>
      </div>
      <li>What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS?</li>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: function foo(){ }();.</li>
      <div class=interview>
        <p>First, to invoke the function we need to wrap the whole function within '()'. so (foo(){})(); this could invoke the function immediately.</p>
      </div>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>What's the difference between a variable that is: null, undefined or undeclared? How would you go about checking for any of these states?</li>
      <p>variable = null; is intentionally to make the value as a null. variable = undefined is something is declared but not assigned. For instance, </p>
      <div class="tutorial">
  var Foo = function(sound) {
    var its_sound = sound;
  }
  bar = new Foo('bowwow!');
  bar.its_sound //undefined
      </div>
      <p>Because it is simply undefined because the scope of var its_sound is only valid inside of Foo function.</p>
      <li>What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?</li>
      <div class=interview>
        <p>To simply put, a closure is the function that returns other function to reveal variables inside of the function. The reason this is important is that we can call the function later (or as a matter of fact) whenever we want. </p>
        <div class=text-editor>
        var foo = function() {
          var bar = 'my friend';
          return function() {
            console.log("im inside of a closure, " + bar);
          }
        };

        var newfn = foo();
        newfn(); //im inside of a closure, my friend
        </div>
        <p>For this case, the returned function will access variable 'bar' and print out. <p>
      </div>
      <li>What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?</li>
      <p>Anoymous function is useful when it is asigned to other varialbes. This is called Anonymous Function Expression. Look at this example.</p>
      <div class="tutorial">
  var addNumber = function(num1, num2) {
    result = num1 + num2;
    return result;
  };
      </div>
      <p>When we call addNumber(4,5), addNumber variable is invoking anonymous function to add two parameters.</p>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>How do you organize your code? (module pattern, classical inheritance?)</li>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>What's the difference between host objects and native objects?</li>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>Difference between: function Person(){}, var person = Person(), and var person = new Person()?</li>
      <div class=interview>
        <p>function Person(){} is a constructor function so that can be instanciate other Person type object. var person = new Person() is exactly how to do it. person is going to inherite all of traits from Person constructor. </p>
      </div>
      <li>What's the difference between .call and .apply?</li>
      <div class=interview>
        <p>.call will call the function with arguments that are passing. The difference between .call and .apply is that apply will take array as an arguments. </p>
      </div>
      <li>Explain Function.prototype.bind.</li>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>When would you use document.write()?</li>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>What's the difference between feature detection, feature inference, and using the UA string?</li>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>Explain AJAX in as much detail as possible.</li>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>Explain how JSONP works (and how it's not really AJAX).</li>
      <div class=interview>
        <p>JSONP is 'JSON with padding'. It's the hacky way of calling XMLHTTPRequest without violating SOP(Same Origin Policy). SOP prevent any unknown server calling API request so JSONP with callback function is pretending the request calls are from a server.</p>
        <p>Better Interpretation: JSONP is a communication technique used in JavaScript programs running in web browsers to request data from a server in a different domain, something prohibited by typical web browsers because of the same-origin policy(SOP).</p>
      </div>
      <li>Have you ever used JavaScript templating?</li>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>If so, what libraries have you used?</li>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>Explain "hoisting".</li>
      <div class=interview>
        <p>If function is created with the'var' keyward, it will be hosisted to the top of the function so it can be called wherever in the script. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="tutorial">
  function foo() {
    var message = 'hello';
    console.log(message);
    (function bar() {
      console.log(message);
    })();
  };
  foo(); //hello hello
  *****compare with this*****
  function foo() {
    var message = 'hello';
    console.log(message);
    (function bar() {
      console.log(message);
      var message = 'hi there!';
    })();
  };
  foo(); //hello undefined
      </div>
      <p>This is caused by hoisting. var message; is hoisted but the expression is not so it resulted in undefined. </p>
      <li>Describe event bubbling.</li>
      <div class=interview>
        <p>
          When there is series of targets selected for the event, it triggers for all the elements. For instance, 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="tutorial">
   &lt;ol class='articles'&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;article1&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;article2&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;article3&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;

   #main.js
   $(".articles").click(function() {
     **This will invoke functions for every li elements
   });
   ***compare with this***
   $(".articles").on('click', 'li', function() {
      $(this).addClass('highlight');
   });
      </div>
      <li>What's the difference between an "attribute" and a "property"?</li>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>Why is extending built-in JavaScript objects not a good idea?</li>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>Difference between document load event and document ready event?</li>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>What is the difference between == and ===?</li>
      <div class=interview>
        <p>In short, unless you know exactly what you are doing, you should never use'=='. '===' which is strick equal sign confirms that the two objects in right and left sides are same in every way like type and value. In performance wise, to determine two objects are '==', a machine have to go through significant process to try to match up two objects. The example of how dangerous to use '==' is '1' == 1 returns 'true' </p>
      </div>
      <li>Explain the same-origin policy with regards to JavaScript.</li>
      <div class=interview>
        <p></p>
      </div>
      <li>Make this work: duplicate([1,2,3,4,5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]</li>
      <div class=interview>
        <div class=text-editor>
          var duplicator = function(args) {
            var newarr = [];
            for (var i=0; i"<"args.length; i++) {
              newarr.push(args[i])
            }
            for (var i=0; i"<"args.length; i++) {
              newarr.push(args[i])
            }
            return newarr;
          };

          ***or***
          function duplicator(input) {
            return input + "," + input
          };
        </div>
      </div>
      <li>Why is it called a Ternary expression, what does the word "Ternary" indicate?</li>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>What is "use strict";? what are the advantages and disadvantages to using it?</li>
      <div class=interview><p></p></div>
      <li>Create a for loop that iterates up to 100 while outputting "fizz" at multiples of 3, "buzz" at multiples of 5 and "fizzbuzz" at multiples of 3 and 5</li>
      <div class=interview>
        <div class=text-editor>
          for (var i=1; i<101; i++) {
            if (i % 3 ===0 && i % 5 === 0) {
              console.log('fizzbuzz');
          } else if (i % 3 ===0) {
              console.log('buzz');
          } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
              console.log('fizz');
          } else {
              console.log(i);
          }
        };
        </div>
      </div>
      <li>Why is it, in general, a good idea to leave the global scope of a website as-is and never touch it?</li>
      <div class=interview>
        <p>Probably because global scope can be used literally globally, you will never know where it is ended up. </p>
      </div>
      <li>Why would you use something like the load event? Does this event have disadvantages? Do you know any alternatives, and why would you use those?</li>
