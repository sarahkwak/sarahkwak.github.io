    <h1>Ruby Cheatsheet for Interview</h1>
  <div class=main-div>
    <h2>Class vs Object</h2>
  <p><strong> Class</strong> is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. In object-oriented terms, we say that your bicycle is an instance of the class of objects known as bicycles.</p>
  <h2>Variables in a Ruby Class</h2>
  <p>Instance Variables: Instance variables are available across methods for any particular instance or object. That means that instance variables change from object to object. Instance variables are preceded by the at sign (@) followed by the variable name.</p>

  <p>Class Variables: Class variables are available across different objects. A class variable belongs to the class and is a characteristic of a class. They are preceded by the sign @@ and are followed by the variable name. We don't really use class variable much..</p>
  <div class="text-editor">
  class Customer
   @@no_of_customers=0

   def initialize(id, name, addr)
      @cust_id=id
      @cust_name=name
      @cust_addr=addr
   end
  end

  </div>
  <h2>Ruby Pseudo-Variables</h2>
<p>They are special variables that have the appearance of local variables but behave like constants. You can not assign any value to these variables.</p>
<li>self: The receiver object of the current method.</li>
<li>true: Value representing true.</li>
<li>false: Value representing false.</li>
<li>nil: Value representing undefined.</li>
<li>__FILE__: The name of the current source file.</li>
<li>__LINE__: The current line number in the source file.</li>

<h2>Module</h2>
<p>Modules are a way of grouping together methods, classes, and constants. Modules give you two major benefits.</p>
<li>Modules provide a namespace and prevent name clashes.</li>
<li>Modules implement the mixin facility.</li>

<p>Modules define a namespace, a sandbox in which your methods and constants can play without having to worry about being stepped on by other methods and constants.</p>
<div class=text-editor>
  ☕Module written in support.rb file
  module Week
     FIRST_DAY = "Sunday"
     def Week.weeks_in_month
        puts "You have four weeks in a month"
     end
     def Week.weeks_in_year
        puts "You have 52 weeks in a year"
     end
  end

  ☕!/usr/bin/ruby
  $LOAD_PATH << '.'
  require "support"

  class Decade
  include Week
     no_of_yrs=10
     def no_of_months
        puts Week::FIRST_DAY
        number=10*12
        puts number
     end
  end
  d1=Decade.new
  puts Week::FIRST_DAY =>"Sunday"
  Week.weeks_in_month =>"You have four weeks in a month"
  Week.weeks_in_year =>"You have 52 weeks in a year"
  d1.no_of_months =>120

</div>
<h2>Mixins in Ruby</h2>
<p>Ruby does not support multiple inheritance directly but Ruby Modules have another wonderful use called a mixin.</p>
<div class=text-editor>
  module A
     def a1
     end
  end
  module B
     def b1
     end
  end

  class Sample
  include A
  include B
     def s1
     end
  end

  samp=Sample.new
  samp.a1
  samp.b1
  samp.s1
