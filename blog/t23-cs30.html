    <h4>MVC (Model, View and Controller) Design Pattern</h4>
    <p>Model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user.</p>
    <p>There are two important concept in MVC Framework. First is the 'design pattern' and the second is the 'sepration of concern'.</p>

    <p><strong>Design Pattern</strong> is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. A design pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. </p>

    <p><strong>Separation of concerns</strong> is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern. A concern is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as the details of the hardware the code is being optimized for, or as specific as the name of a class to instantiate. A program that embodies SoC well is called a modular program. Modularity, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by encapsulating information inside a section of code that has a well-defined interface. Encapsulation is a means of information hiding.</p>

    <h4>SSL(Secure Sockets Layer)</h4>
    <p>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client‚Äîtypically a web server (website) and a browser; or a mail server and a mail client (e.g., Outlook).</p>
    <p>SSL allows sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and login credentials to be transmitted securely. Normally, data sent between browsers and web servers is sent in plain text‚Äîleaving you vulnerable to eavesdropping. If an attacker is able to intercept all data being sent between a browser and a web server they can see and use that information.</p>

    <p>For users, the site security can be assured by looking at http's' site with green bar on the address header and the Security lock symbol.</p>
    <p>The concept of SSL and SSL Certification aren't hard to understand but as a developer, it can be absoultey nightmare to using 3rd party SSL platform.</p>

    <h4>SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</h4>
    <p>There are many ways to do SEO. Google published their <a href='https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/40349?hl=en'>Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide</a> and related materials. </p>
