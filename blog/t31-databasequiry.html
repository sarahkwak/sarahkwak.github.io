	    	<h1> &nbsp;	N+1 Problem - Database Quiry</h1>
	      <h2>Oct 20, 2016</h2>
	    </div>
			<p><strong>When your database slow, what will you do? </p></strong>
			<p>Have you heard about N+1 problems in rails? When we make associations in ActiveRecord and call the associations, it may hit the database unnecessarily more than you may wish.</p>
			<div class="tutorial">
	#deal.rb
	has_many :experts

	#deals_controller.rb
	def index
	 @deals = Deal.all
	end

	#index.html.erb
	<% @deals.each do |d| %>
	 <% d.experts.each do |e| %>
	  <%= e.first_name %>
	  <% end %>
	<% end %>
			</div>
		<p>This operation hit total deals number * experts number to just render each expert's name. Instead of we can individually hit deal and its experts database, we can 'preload' experts when we load deal. </p>
		<h4>Preload</h4>
		<div class="tutorial">
  @deals = Deal.preload(:experts)
		</div>
		<p>This will preload all experts instance associated with all deals. I actually had to limit(3) because the data was too big so I wasn't able to trace. </p>
		<img src='Screen-shot/preload.png' class='sublime' />
		<p>Preload will actually show 'join' record. So it doesn't have to go back to database every instance. There is another way to solve this problem - eager loading. eager_load is much popular because it allows using 'select' statements.</p>
		<h4>Eater Load</h4>
		<div class="tutorial">
 @deals = Deal.eager_load(:experts).where(experts {name: 'Sarah'}).limit(10)
		</div>
		<p>Eager loading is actually using LEFT OUTER JOIN. In terms of performance, eger_load nad preload are pretty similar. So which one to use?</p>
		<h4>Includes</h4>
		<p>Ya know that rails is pretty smart. They figure out and make '.includes' for you. </p>
		<div class="tutorial">
	@deals = Deal.includes(:experts).where(experts {name: 'Sarah'}).limit(10)
		</div>
		<p>Includes makes a decision to use either eager_load or preload. If you are not use .where, it will use preload otherwise it will use eager_load. This is pretty cool, huh?</p>
		<h4>Count - Customized database quiry</h4>
		<p>Let's say you want to show how many experts are in individual deals.</p>
		<div class="tutorial">
  @deals = Deal.all
  <% @deals.each do |d| %>
   <%= d.experts.count %>
  <% end %>
		</div>
		<p>Let's say we have expert and expert_category classes.</p>
		<div class="tutorial">
  # expert_category.rb
  has_many :expert
  expert_type = ExpertCategory.create(description: 'Developer')

  # expert.rb 
  belongs_to :expert_category 
  expert = Expert.create(first_name: 'sarah', expert_category: 1)
		</div>
		<p>In order to render experts number by expert_category, we will do operation like this: </p>
		<div class="tutorial">
  <% @expert_category = ExpertCategory.all %>
  <% @expert_category.each do |ec| %>
   <%= ec.experts.count %>
  <% end %>
		</div>
  <img src='Screen-shot/custom_quiry.png' class='sublime'/>
  <p>In this case, unfortunately, includes or eager_load do not make the quiry different. Becuase it is separate quiry. Although expert_category and experts are loaded, the count operation need to be done separately. In this case we can make hash of the each count by using 'group' method. </p>
  <div class="tutorial">
@experts_category_counts = Expert.group("experts.expert_category_id").count
=>
{
    2 => 60,
    1 => 53,
    7 => 67,
    5 => 208
}
<% @experts_category = ExpertCategory.all %>
<% @experts_category.each do |ec| %>
 <% ec.experts.each do |ex| %>
	<%= ex.first_name + @experts_category_counts[ex.id] %>
 <% end %>
<% end %>
  </div>
		</div>
		</main>
