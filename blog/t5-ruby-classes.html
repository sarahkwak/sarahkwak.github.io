      <h6>Classes and Its Classy Methods</h1>

<h4>Class. Ruby's First-Class Object</h4>
<p><strong>Classes</strong> in ruby are first-class objects. We've used classes all alone. String, Integers, Floats, Arrays and Hashes are all the "Class" in ruby. Thus when we create them, we says </p>
<div class=text-editor>
  arr = Array.new
  hash = Hash.new

  class Person
   puts "I am a person"
  end

</div>
<p>So when do you want to make a class? Let's just say you have many friends and want to make an old fashioned addressbook with their name, telephone number, e-mail address and address (we we can send a christmas card). So what you need to do is:
<div class=text-editor>
  name: Sarah Kwak
  phone_num: 324-2987
  e-mail: awesomesarah@sarah.kwak
  address: Awesome city, CA, 94033

</div>
<p>In program, we can make individual person and fill up infomation. Easy. But.. what about you have 100 friends? Instead of typing all the information, we can make the class "ContactList" and put only values so we don't have to duplicate same elements 100 times. </p>

<div class=text-editor>
  class ContactList
      def contact_info(name, tel_num, e_mail, address)
        p @name = name
        p @tel_num = tel_num
        p @e_mail = e_mail
        p @address = address
      end
  end

  sarah = ContactList.new
  sarah.contact_info("sarah", "324-2987", "awesomesarah@sarah.kwak",
  "Awesome city, CA, 94033")

 #So we can just build each friend's information using ContactList class.
</div>

<p>When a new class is created, an object of type Class is <strong>initialized</strong> and assigned to a <strong>global constance</strong> in this case 'Person'. </p>

<div class=text-editor>
  sarah = Person.new
  sarah
  # => "I am a person"

</div>
<p>When Person.new is called to create a new object, the 'new' method in class is run.</p>

<h4>Scope of Variables</h4>
<h3>$Global and CONSTANT Variable</h3>
<P>Global and Constant variables are similar. Both have wide global scope. The difference is that constant will throw a warning if you try to change the value while the program is running</p>

<h3>@@Class and @Instance Varialbe</h3>
<p><strong>Class veriable </strong>means that the variable exist over all instances of a class. Class variable is started with @@</p>
<div class=text-editor>
  class Animal
    def initialize
      @@num = 4
    end

    def num_leg
      @@num
    end

    def evolved_leg(num)
      @@num = num
    end

  end

    dog = Animal.new
    monkey = Animal.new
    p dog.num_leg
    p monkey.num_leg
    puts "Here comes difference between class and instance variable"
    p monkey.evolved_leg(2)
    p monkey.num_leg #=>This will completely change num_leg to 2
    p dog.num_leg #This will return 2 as well

</div>
<p>Do exactly same exercise with <strong>instance variable</strong>
<div class=text-editor>
  class Animal
    def initialize
      @num = 4
    end

    def num_leg
      @num
    end

    def evolved_leg(num)
      @num = num
    end

  end

    dog = Animal.new
    monkey = Animal.new
    p dog.num_leg
    p monkey.num_leg
    puts "Here comes difference between class and instance variable"
    p monkey.evolved_leg(2)
    p monkey.num_leg #=>This will completely change num_leg to 2
    p dog.num_leg #This will return 4 because num = 4 only applys to evolved_leg (instance) variable.

</div>
<p>To answer the qeustion of which variable to choose,
  @@class variable will be appropriate when you want to make a variable accessible to ALL <strong>INSTANCES of the CLASS</strong>.</p>
  <p>@instance vaiable will be appripriate when you want to make a variable accessible to ALL <strong> METHODS in the CLASS</strong></p>


<p><strong>Instance Variables</strong> are just an object's variable. The difference of instance and local variables are - first, instance variables have @ in front of their names. Second, instance variables will be visible to different methods inside of class. Instance variable will be visible to the whole instances of the classes. On the other hand, <strong>local variables</strong> is visible only to that method or the 'block'.</p>

<div class =text-editor>
  class Person

    def fav_num
      @fav_num = rand(9)
    end

    def num_friends
      friends = rand(5)
    end

    def my_info
     puts @fav_num
     puts friends
    end

  end

  sarah = Person.new
  sarah.fav_num
  sarah.num_friends

  # =>
    4
    2
</div>

<div class=text-editor>
  #But if I ask to run this code, it will give an Error message

  sarah = Person.new
  sarah.my_info

  practice.rb:13:in `my_info': undefined local variable or method `friends' for
   #<Person:0x007fdda396b238 @fav_num=7> (NameError)
</div>

<div class=text-editor>
  #Because my_info can't get access to local variable 'friends', the code will not
  run and gives error. The problem will be solved, when friends change local to
  instance variable.
  friends => @friends

  class Person

    def fav_num
      @fav_num = rand(9)
    end

    def num_friends
      @friends = rand(5)
    end

    def my_info
     puts @fav_num
     puts @friends
    end

  end

  sarah = Person.new
  sarah.my_info

  # =>
  3
  4
</div>

<h4>Initialize</h4>
<p>When a class is bone, one thing is always going to happen. Run initialize method. Initialize will always execute every time we create a new instance of the class. We can take advantage this automatic initialization process to set an object's state at the time of the object's creation. </p>
<p>Inside initialize method, we can pass the valiable and value.</p>
<div class=text-editor>
  class Person
    def initialize(name, sex)
      @name = name
      @sex = sex
    end

    def name
      @name = name  #all these methods are returning is actual variable name
      itself!
    end

    def sex
      @sex = sex
    end
  end

</div>
<p>Because initialize method will run whenever Person was instantiate and called, name and sex variable will be available through out the class. This is the reason we initialize the instance variable so they can be accessed by any method called within the class </p>

<h4>Getter / Setter Methods: attr_reader, attr_writer and attr_accessor</h4>
<p>Remember that instance vaiable can be only accessed by object's own methods? This is good. Becuase in that way, we can have absolute control on our methods and variables WITHIN the class. What do I mean by 'control'?  <strong>Can we change the value of the instance vaiable from outside?</strong> This is where we need to use 'getter' method like attr_reader, writer and accessor. </p>
<p>The attr_reader method defines the reader method for you. This is a convenient way to define variables. It is always good idea to wrap instance variables in accessor methods instead of directly referring to variables.</p>

<div class=text-editor>
  # attr_reader will do this
  def name
    @name
  end
  # attr_writer will do this
  def tel_num=(new_num)
    @tel_num = new_num
  end
  # attr_accessor will do both of aboves
