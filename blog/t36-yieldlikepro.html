    <p>I'm currently reading Agile Web Development with Rails 5 and following steps to create simple book store web. It is basic rails app but I'm actually suprised the fact that how things the author do differently. I also enjoy every page and learn new tricks and rails' way of doing things! There are so much to learn but here are some of things that I've learned.</p>
    <p>The task is to creating helper method <strong>hidden_div_items</strong>to render partial if there is a cart.</p>
    <div class="tutorial">
    <% if @cart %>
      <%= hidden_div_if(@cart.line_items.empty?, id: 'cart') do %>
        <%= render @cart %>
      <% end %>
    <% end %>

    def hidden_div_if(condition, attributes = {}, &block)
      if condition
        attributes["style"] = "display:none;"
      end
        content_tag("div", attributes, &block)
    end
    </div>

    <p>First, I haven't used content_tag before so that's something new. If you aren't familier with this, click <a href="https://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/TagHelper/content_tag">here</a>. Basically, it will create html tag for you. You can pass the tag as symbol ':div', or string "div". If you look at the apidock, the last arg of the content_tag is '&block'. </p>
    <div class="tutorial">
      content_tag(name, content_or_options_with_block = nil, options = nil, escape = true, &block)
    </div>
    <p>By definition, it "Returns an <strong>HTML block tag </strong>of type name surrounding the content. Add HTML attributes by passing an <strong>attributes hash</strong> to options."</p>

    <p>Now, let's get into '&block' and 'yield' busineses.</p>
    <div class="tutorial">
    def print_myself(arg, &block)
      yield(arg)
    end

    print_myself("Horay!!") do |word|
      puts word
    end
            ===== OR =====
    print_myself("Horay!!") { |word| puts word }
    </div>
    <p>Both print_myself will call the &block with arg. When you call the function, your block looks kind of funny. It looks like completely different entity from arg. BUT this is a part of attributes for the print_myself. </p>
    <p>In the above example of hidden_div_if, it looks even weirder because it looks like we are passing 2 arguments - @cart.line_items.empty? and id: 'cart' and the hidden_div_if is also taking 2 arguments and make attributes as an empty hash by default. So here is what's going on: </p>
    <ol class='ordered-list'>
      <li>id: 'cart' is going to be convert as attributes[:id] => 'cart'. If you are printing attributes inside of hidden_div_if, it will say: {:id=>"cart"} </li>
      <li>attributes["style"] = "display:none;" is adding 'style' option to the attributes, which is an option of content_tag. The name 'attributes' is optional. </li>
      <li>&block - This is what is passed and execute when the function is called. Means, it will yield <%= render @cart %>. Basically, the content_tag will 'yield' the &block. </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
