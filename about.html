    <h1>A Brief history of Sarah</h1>
  <p>I was born and grow up in Korea. I studied Chemistry in college. After the graduation, instead of study further in Chemistry, I started my career in a diplomatic world. My first job was the Senior Visa Officer at Australian Embassy in Seoul. I worked there for 4 years and moved to Australia to study Master's of Commerce in University of New South Wales. After finishing my course in 2008, I decided to move to Canada for new life.</p>

  <p>Searching for a job wasn't an easy journey at first. After all, I don't know anyone in Canada and I have no experience and education background. I studied French and work as an intern at Oxfam Canada while I was looking for a permanent position.</p>
  <p>Shortly after, I was employed as a Quality Assurance Representative for a company managing the submarine program for Canadian Navy and I moved to beautiful Victoria, BC in 2012. </p>

  <p>Now I am in California learning programming languages. I am very excited about new career and life in San Francisco. </p>
