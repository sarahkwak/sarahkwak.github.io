    <h1>Korea after 5 years</h1>
    <p>I left Korea in 2007. I've been mainly in Australia, Canada and the U.S for the last 9 years. I visited Korea briefly last year to attend my grandma's funeral but I haven't spent much time on sightseeing or meeting friends in Korea so it was really the first time in 5 years.</p>
    <h4>So What's the Change? </h4>
    <p>It is absolutely true, even 5 years ago, that Korea's transportation system is probably one of the best in the world. I've travelled many countries in Europe, various cities in North America (mainly east and west), Australia and major cities in Asia and I can proudly put South Korean transportation system one of the top. There are several reasons for it. The system is cheap, efficient, clean and informative. They have Korean, English, Japanes and Chinese anouncement for each station and you can go anywhere in Seoul and major satellite cities under $5. It never delays and waiting time is under 10-15 mins. The only downside in my opinion is, it gets over-crowded during commute hours. I mean, it's really over-crowded.</p>
