    <h1>Teach Brian to Code</h1>
      <p><span>Meet Brian. </span>He is 3 years old puggle (Pug and Beaggle cross) and he loves to chasing moving objects(especially cats!), learn new stuff and <span>COOKIES!</span>
      <p>One day at the dog play ground, Brian heard that there is a <a href="https://medium.com/@awelfle/teach-your-cat-to-code-ca3cb20dd76f">website teaches cat to code</a> (Yes. You heard me right, a CAT!). He couldn't believe there is such a thing (but after all, cats are smart creatures and he recall he watched youtube video that a cat plays piano). He asked me if I can find a website teaches dog to code. After several hours of researching, I told him that unfortunately there is no such a thing. Brian smiled at me and said I should start one. </p>
      <p>As I am starting new journey of learning programming languages, I think it will be fun to keep the record on progress. This may help others like Brian who wants to start learning. </p>
      <p>In case you want to know little bit about me, I am a Korean-Canadian living in California. Other than learning programining languages, I spend my time with Brian, brewing beer(or apple cyder) or developing a new vegetarian recipies. You can read more about me <a href="about.html"><strong>here</strong></a></p>
