      Hello World! This is my first week in learning web development. I am exciting as my dog, Brian, when he heard the word "Cookie"!
    </p>
    <p>
       Learning new thing could be intimidating experience but I found it facinating. I haven't been a best learner but I can tell you I have always big passion about learning a new stuff. I can say I am a professional learner.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I learn more and more about web development everyday I would like to share with all of you about my progress. I hope that this will help many new learners and dreamers in web developing world!

    <p> Today's topic is web basics.</p>
      <h5>What is Internet?</h5>
      <p>
        There are plenty of good places explains about internet. I found this 5 mininutes vidio clip explains the best about <a href:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc>How The Internet Works</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically, internet is a 'wire' that connects other computers. Unless you have a super computer or sort, most of devices are connected through ISP(Internet Servie Providers).
      </P>
      <h5>What is Web Browser?</h5>
      <p> A program(desktop software like Chrome) that allows you browsing a web and enjoy other fantastic stuff </p>

      <h5>What is DNS?</h5>
      <p>Domain Name System that works like yellowpage. Apparently there is a issue with DNS delaying that it takes up to 24 hours for new web address becomes available. When a browser request a website, the ISP send a request to DNS to look up the record of the website. Because they want to reduce the web traffic and time to show the website, they generally copy DNS record. That's called "cashing". Mostly, cashing process works great (it makes web search faster!) but when there is a new website was not in that particular copy of DNS, you are scrwed. You can't access it. Generally they are updating the copy within several hours so don't worry, it will eventually let you go sarahkwak.com</p>
      <h5>What is Domain name and IP address?</h5>
      <p>
        Those are same thing but in different language. Domain name is English name for IP address, which looks like 64.233.191.255 - good luck with remembering them. So they give something more memorable and make sense name like google.com or youtube.com
      </p>
      <h5>Different between website and web app?</h5>
      <p>
        Web app: The key word is "Interaction". Web apps are the basement works of website (presentation). It includes all programs makes dynamic interaction between server and database. Website is the final product of web apps. In general, website can be composed by simple HTML, CSS and maybe Javascript.</p>
        <h5>What is www?</h5>
        <p>
          World wide web is a program allows to sharing information, red and interact with other computers through a web browser.</P>
